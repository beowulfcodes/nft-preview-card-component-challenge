## My process

- First, lay down all the images and texts (paragraphs, h1s, etc...) sequentially.
- Next, group the images and texts accordingly into containers/cards.
- Then, arrange this containers/cards into flexbox structure (I am using flexbox, you can use grid if you want to)
- Now, create sections with headings. If your content has distinct categories or sections, you can separate them using headings (e.g., h1, h2, etc...) to provide a clear hierarchy.\
- And lastly, apply styling and formatting according to the style-guide.md.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I might research for the next couple of hours on how to properly utilize media queries. Also, is mobile-first design a good practice? I've been starting my design in desktop, though...


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Tutorial](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html) - This helped me on how to use flexbox.
